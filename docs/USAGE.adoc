== Installation

. Login to your Steam account using the `steamcmd` command line utility
. Login to your GitHub account using the `gh` command line utility
. Set the `STEAM_USERNAME` to the steam account username used previously

== Server configuration

All configuration regarding your server must go into a configuration file. This file is expected to use PSD1 format.

Exemple file:

```psd1
include::EXAMPLE.psd1[]
```

CAUTION: Server and Headless affinity are bitmasks, allowing each process to run on different CPU cores for performance purpose. See https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.process.processoraffinity#system-diagnostics-process-processoraffinity[Microsoft documentation]

== Usage

NOTE: All commands require administrator privileges

The following commands are available:

* `Install-ArmaServer`: This command will install the server:
** Download dedicated server binaries
** Download addons from Steam workshop
** Download missions from GitHub releases
** Install BI Keys, mission files, and config files
* `Update-ArmaServer`: This command will refresh the server missions and config only
** Intended as a faster alternative when you want to test a mission / config
* `Start-ArmaServer`: Starts the server using the current user's context
** If the server is already running, it will try to stop it first
* `Stop-ArmaServer`: Stops the currently running server

IMPORTANT: Due to a bug in steamcmd, download of larger mods might timeout.
