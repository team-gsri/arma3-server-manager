= GSRI server manager: usage guide

== Requirements

_FIXME_

== Configuration

All configuration regarding your server must go into a configuration file. This file is expected to use PSD1 format. You can use a custom path for the file using `-ConfigFilename`

Exemple file:

```psd1
@{
    Port             = 2302
    ServerAffinity   = 5
    HeadlessAffinity = 10
    GithubRepository = 'team-gsri/Scorpion'
    
    Hostname         = '[FR] GROUPE DE COMBAT AEROPORTE | www.gsri.team'
    Password         = ''
    Players          = 32
    Admins           = @(
        76561197967609383 # Arwyn
    )

    Mods             = @(
        # mods required by both server and clients
        450814997 # CBA
    )
    ClientMods       = @(
        # used to download BI keys from workshop
    )
    ServerMods       = @(
        # mods loaded on the server but keys are not enforced
    )
}
```

CAUTION: Server and Headless affinity is a bitmask, allowing each process to run on different CPU cores for performance purpose. See https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.process.processoraffinity#system-diagnostics-process-processoraffinity[Microsoft documentation]
